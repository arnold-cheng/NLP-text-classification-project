# NLP Text Classification Project using Fast.ai

This project was a take-home assignment for an interview I had. The task was to create a model that could classify news articles of (at least) the type (topic) "EARN" in the dataset.
In this project, I use what I have learned in the fast.ai course to create a NLP text classifier to do the task at hand.
